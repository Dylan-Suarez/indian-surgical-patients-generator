- Severity: Progressive from mild to severe

**Key Teaching Points**:
- Pain migration pattern
- Atypical presentations in elderly/pregnant patients
- Complications: perforation, abscess formation
- Surgical approaches: open vs laparoscopic

**Assessment Questions**:
- History Taking: "Describe the typical pain progression"
- Physical Examination: "Demonstrate and explain McBurney's sign"
- Investigations: "When would you order CT vs ultrasound?"
- Management: "Compare laparoscopic vs open appendectomy"

#### 2. Gallbladder Disease Module
**Learning Outcomes**: Students will recognize acute cholecystitis presentations

**Case Parameters**:
- Age Range: Middle-aged to elderly
- Gender: Female predominance
- Severity: Mild to severe with complications

**Key Teaching Points**:
- Murphy's triad: fever, RUQ pain, jaundice
- Gallstone vs acalculous cholecystitis
- Timing of surgery: early vs delayed
- ERCP indications

#### 3. Hernia Emergency Module
**Learning Outcomes**: Students will identify surgical emergencies

**Case Parameters**:
- Age Range: All ages (different hernia types)
- Gender: Male predominance for inguinal
- Severity: Focus on strangulated cases

**Key Teaching Points**:
- Reducible vs irreducible vs strangulated
- Time-critical nature of strangulated hernia
- Assessment of bowel viability
- Emergency surgical techniques

## 📊 Assessment Strategies

### Formative Assessment

#### Case-Based Exercises
1. **Generate** 5 random cases
2. **Present** minimal information initially
3. **Progressive revelation** of additional data
4. **Student responses** at each stage
5. **Immediate feedback** on reasoning

#### Peer Teaching Sessions
- Students generate cases for classmates
- Collaborative problem-solving approach
- Teaching consolidates learning

### Summative Assessment

#### OSCE Stations

- **Time Allocation**: 10-15 minutes per case
- **Assessment Criteria**: History, examination, diagnosis, management
- **Standardization**: Same cases across all students

#### Written Examinations
- **MCQs**: Based on generated case scenarios
- **Short Answer Questions**: Clinical reasoning problems
- **Long Cases**: Comprehensive case analysis
